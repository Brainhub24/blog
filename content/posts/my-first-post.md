## Hello World!

Welcome to my blog. Let me first introduce myself. I am Mahmoud[^1], a computer scientist / machine learning scientist / computational biologist. I come originally from Tunisia, but I've been living in Berlin for the last 17 years.
 
My interests include machine learning, MLOPs, data, generative AI, computational biology, and startups. I worked as a research assistant for many years at the [Technische Universität Berlin ]( http://www.tu-berlin.de ) in the [Robotics and Biology Lab ]( http://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de ) under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Brock]( https://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/oliver_brock/). There, I created a new approach to protein structure prediction that combines deep learning and conformational search. At the moment, I am writing my dissertation and a paper about this approach.
 
Last year I joined [ModelMe](https://modelme.tech/) as a founding ML engineer #1. We have been developing software that can generate artificial fashion models for the retail industry. I have been working on model development, training, and setting up the training workflow. Our version alpha is finished, and we plan on deploying it next year!

## This blog
I intend to keep this blog more dynamic than static. I am used to using [Roam](http://www.roamresearch.com), which is a sort of personal wiki / journal / second brain. As I write up ideas, I plan to revisit and interlink them over time. Basically, build a public personal wiki.
 
All content here will always be in draft mode. As [Logan Roy](https://succession.fandom.com/wiki/Logan_Roy) says: "***Nothing is a line. Everything, everywhere is always moving. Forever***"

### What am I going to write about?
 
I plan to write about my interests: AI and machine learning, computational biology, Generative AI, MLOps, Data, and ML infrastructure.
 
### Why write? 
 
In the last couple of years, I've been writing on my personal Roam. That brought me immense joy and helped me think. One thing I've learned from my PhD advisor is that ***writing is thinking***. 
 
### Why write in public?
 
Vanity [^2], perhaps, but also a desire for interaction. Writing here will hopefully lead to some new connections and interactions with like-minded people.

### Why now?
 
Truthfully, I have been thinking about starting a blog for years now, but never had the courage to do it. That is, until I watched a twitch stream by [ George Hotz ]( https://geohot.com/) where he was live coding [ tinygrad ]( https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad ). He opened his editor at one point to view his draft blog post. After adding a few sentences, he paused for a moment, then pushed it.
 
No rereading, no perfecting. He just shipped it.
 
That was an eye-opener for me. I am the kind of perfectionist who tries to get everything perfect. As I watched someone who was quite accomplished ***just do it***, I realized that I should do the same.
 
So, this is my imperfect attempt at writing.
