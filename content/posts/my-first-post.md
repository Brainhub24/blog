Hello World!

Welcome to my blog. Let me first introduce myself. I am Mahmoud[^1], a computer scientist / machine learning scientist / computational biologist. I come originally from Tunisia but I've been living in Berlin for the last 17 years. 

I am interested in ML, MLOps, data, generative AI, computational biology, and startups. I worked for many years as a research assistant at the [Technische Universität Berlin](tu-berlin.de) in the [Robotics and Biology Lab](www.robotics.tu-berlin.de) under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Brock](https://www.robotics.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/oliver_brock/). I worked there on creating a novel approach for protein structure prediction that combines deep learning with conformational search. I am currently writing my dissertation and a paper about the approach.

Last year I joined [ModelMe](https://modelme.tech/) as a founding ML engineer #1. We have been building software that can generate artifical fashion models for the retail industry. I have been working on model developement, training, setting up the training workflow. We have finished our version alpha and we are planning to deploy it next year!
