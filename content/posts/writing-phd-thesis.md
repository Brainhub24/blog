Finally, after years of research[^1], I am seriously writing my dissertation[^2]. Writing was always a struggle for me. Yet, now it comes easy to me. That does not mean that I am a good writer (as you can probably judge), but at least I am writing, which is much better than not writing. Mediocre writing is better than no writing.

Here are the lessons I learned along the way. These probably are most relevant for myself[^3].

### 1. Be mediocre but be profilic
Better focus on quantity than on quality. Don't expect to write great content, or great ideas. Consider yourself average and focus on quantity. Consider writing as a chore and treat it as such. That means wake up everyday, set the timer for three hours, set up your goals for the writing session and write. 

Accept average writing. Don't try to perfect each sentence. If your text is understandable and the point comes across that is sufficient. 

Why does this make sense:

- Writing is a skill. The more you train it the better you gets at it. If you aspire to be a good writer, it makes sense to write as much as possible. 
- Writing is an iterative process, just like coding. Great code is not written sequentially in one go. Usually you start with some part of the code, then go to the next, and move back and forth, refactor, refactor, debug, and at some point you push. The same goes for writing, you write some shitty content first, move to some other paragraph, then back, then edit, then remove, and at some point it is good enough to be pushed.

### 2. Use a workflow
I used to write expecting each sentence to be perfect. I would not move to the next sentence until the previous one was perfect. That made the process take an eternity and made me hate writing. 

That until I've read "Professors as Writers: A Self-Help Guide to Productive Writing" which changed the way I approache writing.




[^1] I started working as a research assistant on March 2013, you can count. As for why it took so long, I could write long pages on that. 
[^2] Serious as in 2-4 pages per day, consistently day after day
[^3] A small self-description of who I am (at least the relevant parts) makes sense at this point. The good: extremely curious, extremely ambitious, creative, smart. The bad: perfectionist, tend to procrastinate.
